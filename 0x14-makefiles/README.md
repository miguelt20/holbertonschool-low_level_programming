<h1 align="center"> Makefile </h1>

If you have multiple source files in c, c++ and others language and want to compile them from Terminal Command, it is hard to write every time. To solve such kind of problem, we use Makefile because during the compilation of large project we need to write numbers of source files as well as linker flags are required, that are not so easy to write again and again.

Makefile is a tool to simplify or to organize code for compilation. Makefile is a set of commands (similar to terminal commands) with variable names and targets to create object file and to remove them. In a single make file we can create multiple targets to compile and to remove object, binary files. You can compile your project (program) any number of times by using Makefile.
