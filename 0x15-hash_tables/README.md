<h1 align="center"> Hash tables </h1>

Hash Table is a data structure which stores data in an associative manner. In hash table, the data is stored in an array format where each data value has its own unique index value. Access of data becomes very fast, if we know the index of the desired data.

Hashing is a technique or process of mapping keys, and values into the hash table by using a hash function. It is done for faster access to elements. The efficiency of mapping depends on the efficiency of the hash function used.

Let a hash function H(x) maps the value x at the index x%10 in an Array. For example if the list of values is [11,12,13,14,15] it will be stored at positions {1,2,3,4,5} in the array or Hash table respectively.
