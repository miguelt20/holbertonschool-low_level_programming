  <h2> C Programming Language </h2>
</div>
<p>
C is a procedural programming language initially developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie">Dennis Ritchie</a> in the year 1972 at Bell Laboratories of AT&T Labs. It was mainly developed as a system programming language to write the UNIX operating system.

The main features of the C language include:

- General Purpose and Portable
- Low-level Memory Access
- Fast Speed
- Clean Syntax

These features make the C language suitable for system programming like an operating system or compiler development.

Many later languages have borrowed syntax/features directly or indirectly from the C language. Like syntax of Java, PHP, JavaScript, and many other languages are mainly based on the C language. C++ is nearly a superset of C language (Only a few programs may compile in C, but not in C++).

So,  if a person learns C programming first, it will help him to learn any modern programming language as well. As learning C help to understand a lot of the underlying architecture of the operating system. Like pointers, working with memory locations, etc.
